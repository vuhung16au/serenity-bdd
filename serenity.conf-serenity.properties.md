# Differences Overview 
Both serenity.conf and serenity.properties are used for configuring Serenity BDD projects. The choice between them depends on personal preference and project requirements. YAML format (serenity.conf) allows for a more structured and readable configuration, while the properties file format (serenity.properties) is simpler and more concise. Each has its own strengths, and the decision often comes down to the developer's familiarity with the format and the specific needs of the project.
